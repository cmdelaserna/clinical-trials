       "'\\n      Acquire intraoperative MMS measurements in vivo. After assessing this approach on excised\\n      tissues, MMS measurements will be aquired directly on the patient from the NMSC excision\\n      site. MMS data will be acquired on patients being treated for NMSC at the Austin Dermatologic\\n      Surgery Center, the surgical site for the dermatology practice of Seton/University of Texas\\n      Physicians group. Similar to the measurements on freshly excised tissues, MMS data will be\\n      acquired in a grid pattern on the excision site. The site will be blotted with gauze to\\n      remove residual blood prior to the measurement, and continuously blotted as needed until all\\n      measurements have been taken. The handheld probe of the MMS enables assessment of both the\\n      wound periphery and deeper layers of tissue to determine if any tumor is remaining. For this\\n      initial pilot study, we plan to take measurements on 10 patients (5 BCC, 5 SCC), along with\\n      corresponding normal tissue measurements.\\n\\n      Retrospective analysis of MMS sensitivity and specificity. The MMS technique is an\\n      information rich modality providing both morphological and functional parameters of the\\n      interrogated tissue that could be correlated to known tumor pathology. However, this\\n      extracted information will require development of sophisticated spectral analysis models\\n      which would be beyond the scope of the current study. Therefore, for the purpose of this\\n      study, standard statistical techniques will be used to determine the classification power of\\n      MMS for tumor margin detection. While this approach does not fully elucidate the underlying\\n      pathology responsible for the classification, these types of models have been shown to\\n      perform at or better than those based on a morphological approach. This approach has been\\n      previously employed to classify skin cancer with high diagnostic accuracy. The final outcome\\n      of this study will result in the sensitivity and specificity of MMS compared to\\n      histopathology during Mohs surgery. These results will allow for the estimation of the\\n      potential benefit of an intraoperative margin assessment technique. This type of\\n      retrospective study will provide a proof of concept that would warrant further development\\n      and prospective studies of the MMS approach.\\n    '"
